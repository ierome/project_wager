      <p>
        ANY MATCH DISPUTE will require evidence. Not providing evidence of a
        player not playing within the rules will render your dispute claim
        invalid. Do not accept any game that does not meet the agreed upon
        selected match settings. Any player proven to violate pre selected match
        settings will lead to forfeiture of match by player. If both players
        play the match and violate any match settings the match will be voided.
      </p>
      <p>
        MATCHES must be completed within the specified time. There are no
        forfeits and at no time should a player claim a win BEFORE a match is
        played. Players are advised to complete their matches and report the
        final scores. In the event of a player quitting or disconnecting while
        losing or tied in match, it will be considered an automatic forfeit. A
        dispute will be created when reporting a score from a game that was not
        completed. If players are found to report false information, wins for
        unplayed games, or false scores, she/he will automatically forfeit game
        and funds. **Any attempt or effort to purposely deceive will lead to
        funds being frozen and automatic ban from site.
